# Issue Tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub Issues. Use the `gh` CLI for issue operations once the public `ariadne-thread` remote is connected.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels and relevant comments.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`.
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`.
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`.

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Current Bootstrap State

No remote is configured yet in this workspace. Until it is, do not invent a parallel local issue format. Keep durable planning context in `PRD.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/adr/`.
